In finance,an exchange rate between two currencies is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another.
It is a useful tool which gives us the value of certain amount of one currency to be converted in to a different currency.
It is also regarded as the value of one countryâ€™s currency in terms of another currency.
In this project we are going to display a web window in which currency options are given and the conversion value is displayed in the next window.
